# Efficient global context graph convolution for hyperspectral image classification ## IGARSS-2022
## Introduction
This work focuses on integrating long-range contextual information for HSI classification. Concretely, the efficient graph learning module is embedded in the FCN  as a learning unit to capture the long-range contextual information and aggregate features to infer underlying semantic relationships with computation efficiency.

## Requirements
* Ununtu 16.0 
* python 3.7 
* Pytorch 1.4
* pytorch-geometric

## Training and Testing
put HSI dataset in ```Datasets``` folder <br>
run the ```Demo_IP.py``` for Indian Pines dataset training and testing<br>
